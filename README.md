## **What is this project about?**
This project provides a robust system for uploading audio files, transcribing speech to text, and enhancing the transcription by removing repetitive stuttering patterns. It aims to make speech transcription more accessible and user-friendly for individuals with speech disfluencies, ensuring a clean, natural representation of their speech.

## **Whom does it benefit?**
This project benefits:
- **Individuals with speech disfluencies**, such as stuttering, by generating transcriptions that omit repetitive phrases.
- **Accessibility advocates** looking to create inclusive digital tools.
- **Developers and researchers** focusing on building assistive technology applications.
- **General users** needing accurate and clear transcriptions of audio files.

## **Technology Used**
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Flask**: Web framework to handle API requests.
- **React**: For the web app and UI
- **Pydub**: Audio processing for resampling and formatting.
- **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API**: Transcription of audio files.
- **OpenAI GPT API**: Enhancing transcription by removing repetitive patterns.
- **Flask-CORS**: Enables cross-origin requests.
- **dotenv**: For securely managing environment variables.

## **Further Enhancements**
- **Multi-language Support**: Extend transcription and enhancement capabilities to multiple languages.
- **Mobile Integration**: Create a mobile app for recording and transcribing audio on the go.
- **Speaker Identification**: Incorporate speaker diarization for multi-speaker transcription.
- **Customizable Outputs**: Allow users to choose the degree of enhancement (e.g., mild repetition removal vs. aggressive).

This project has a strong foundation to evolve into a comprehensive tool for accessible transcription services!
